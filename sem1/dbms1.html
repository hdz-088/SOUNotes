        <h1 id="head2">Application of DBMS</h1>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Railway reservation system:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The railway reservation system database plays a very important role
            by keeping record of ticket booking, train’s departure time and
            arrival status and also gives information regarding train late to
            people through the database
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Library Management System:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now-a-days it’s become easy in the Library to track each book and
            maintain it because of the database. This happens because there are
            thousands of books in the library.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is very difficult to keep a record of all books in a copy or
            register.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now DBMS used to maintain all the information related to book issue
            dates, name of the book, author and availability of the book.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Banking:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Banking is one of the main applications of databases. We all know
            there will be a thousand transactions through banks daily and we are
            doing this without going to the bank. This is all possible just
            because of DBMS that manages all the bank transactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Universities and colleges:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now-a-days examinations are done online. So, the universities and
            colleges are maintaining DBMS to store Student’s registrations
            details, results, courses and grade all the information in the
            database. For example, telecommunications. Without DBMS there is no
            telecommunication company. DBMS is most useful to these companies to
            store the call details and monthly post-paid bills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Credit Card Transactions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The purchase of items and transactions of credit cards are made
            possible only by DBMS. A credit card holder has to know the
            importance of their information that all are secured through DBMS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Social Media Sites:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            By filling the required details we are able to access social media
            platforms. Many users sign up daily on social websites such as
            Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram. All the information related to
            the users are stored and maintained with the help of DBMS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Finance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now-a-days there are lots of things to do with finance like storing
            sales, holding information and finance statement management etc.
            these all can be done with database systems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Military:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In military areas the DBMS is playing a vital role. Military keeps
            records of soldiers and it has so many files that should be kept
            secure and safe. DBMS provides a high security to military
            information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Online Shopping(E-COMMERCE):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now-a-days we all do Online shopping without wasting the time by
            going shopping with the help of DBMS. The products are added and
            sold only with the help of DBMS like Purchase information, invoice
            bills and payment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Human Resource Management:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The management keeps records of each employee’s salary, tax and work
            through DBMS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Manufacturing companies make products and sell them on a daily
            basis. To keep records of all those details DBMS is used
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Airline Reservation system:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Just like the railway reservation system, airlines also need DBMS to
            keep records of flights arrival, departure and delay status.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head3">File System Disadvantages</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>

        <h1 id="head4">Purpose of DBMS</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provides a safe and effective platform to manage vast amount of data
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides services like data organization, storage and manipulation
          </li>
          <li>Efficient storage and retrieval of data</li>
          <li>Eliminates data redundancy and anomalies</li>
          <li>Protection of sensitive data</li>

        <h1 id="head5">Tier Based Database Architecture</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            DBMS architecture depends upon how users are connected to get their
            request done
          </li>
          <li>There are 3 tiers of database architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h1>1-Tier Architecture</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Database is directly available to users</li>
          <li>Changes done by users will effect the database too</li>
          <li>
            It is used for development of local applications where developers
            can directly communicate with the database for quick response
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="head7">Data Mapping</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The process of transforming requests and results between the three
          levels is called mapping.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Conceptual/Internal Mapping:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It relates conceptual schema with internal schema.</li>
              <li>
                It defines correspondence between the conceptual schema and the
                database stored in physical devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                It specifies how conceptual records and fields are presented at
                the internal level.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the structure of stored database is changed, then
                conceptual/internal mapping must be changed accordingly and
                conceptual schema can remain invariant.
              </li>
              <li>
                There could be one mapping between conceptual and internal
                levels.

            <p><strong>External/Conceptual Mapping:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It relates each external schema with conceptual schema.</li>
              <li>
                It defines correspondence between a particular external view and

        <h1 id="head8">Data Independence</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Data independency is the ability to modify a schema definition in one

        <h1 id="head9">Database Users</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Database users are categorized based up on their interaction with the
          database.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Database Administrator (DBA):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Person/team who defines the schema and also controls the 3 levels of
            database.
          </li>
          <li>
            The DBA will then create a new account id and password for the user
            if he/she need to access the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            DBA is also responsible for providing security to the database and
            he allows only the <strong>authorized users</strong> to
            access/modify the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            DBA is responsible for the problems such as
            <strong>security breaches</strong> and poor system response time.
          </li>
          <li>
            DBA also monitors the <strong>recovery and backup</strong> and
            provide technical support.
          </li>
          <li>
            The DBA has a DBA account in the DBMS which called a
            <strong>system</strong> or <strong>superuser</strong> account.
          </li>
          <li>
            DBA <strong>repairs damage</strong> caused due to hardware and/or
            software failures.
          </li>
          <li>
            DBA is the one having privileges to perform
            <strong>DCL</strong> (Data Control Language) operations such as
            GRANT and REVOKE, to allow/restrict a particular user from accessing
            the database.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Naïve/Parametric End Users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Parametric End Users are the unsophisticated who don’t have any DBMS
            knowledge but they frequently use the database applications in their
            daily life to get the desired results.
          </li>
          <li>
            For examples, Railway’s ticket booking users, Clerks in any bank
          </li>

        <br />
        <p><strong>System Analyst:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            System Analyst is a user who analyses the requirements of parametric
            end users.
          </li>
          <li>
            They check whether all the requirements of end users are satisfied.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Sophisticated Users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sophisticated users are familiar with the database.</li>
          <li>
            They can develop their own database applications according to their
            requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
            They don’t write the program code but they interact the database by
            writing SQL queries directly through the query processor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Database Designers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data Base Designers are the users who design the structure of
            database which includes tables, indexes, views, triggers, stored
            procedures and constraints which are usually enforced before the
            database is created or populated with data.
          </li>
          <li>
            He/she controls what data must be stored and how the data items to
            be related.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is responsibility of Database Designers to understand the
            requirements of different user groups and then create a design which
            satisfies the need of all the user groups.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Application Programmers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Application Programmers (System Analysts or Software Engineers) are
            the back-end programmers who writes the code for the application
            programs.
          </li>
          <li>These programs could be written in Programming languages</li>
          <li>
            Application programmers design, debug, test, and maintain set of
            programs called “canned transactions” for the Naïve (parametric)
            users in order to interact with database.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Casual Users/Temporary Users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Casual Users are the users who occasionally use/access the database
            but each time when they access the database they require the new
            information
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Specialized users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Specialized users are sophisticated users who write specialized
            database application that does not fit into the traditional data-
            processing framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            Among these applications are computer aided-design systems,
