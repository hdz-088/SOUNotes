              Time management is the process of <strong>planning</strong> and
              exercising <strong>conscious</strong> control of time spent on
              specific activities especially to increase
              <strong>effectiveness</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, and
              <strong>productivity</strong>, Consciousness, at its simplest, is
              <strong>awareness</strong> of internal and external existence.

          <li>
              <strong>Effectiveness</strong> is the capability of producing a
              desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When
              something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or
              expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency</strong> is the often measurable ability to avoid
            making mistakes or wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and
            time while performing a task. In a more general sense, it is the
            ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Productivity</strong> is the efficiency of production of
              goods or services expressed by some measure. Measurements of
              productivity are often expressed as a ratio of an aggregate output
              to a single input or an aggregate input used in a production
              process, i.e. output per unit of input, typically over a specific
              period of time.
          </li><br>
          <li>
              A time management system is a designed combination of processes,
              tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a
              necessity in any project development as it determines the project
              completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that
              both technical and structural differences in time management exist
              due to variations in cultural concepts of time.

              </li>
              <li>
                You can allocate specific time blocks to different tasks, making
                it easier to tackle them without feeling overwhelmed.

              </li>
              <li>
                You can employ techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix or the ABCD
                method to determine which tasks need immediate attention and
                which can wait.
              </li>
              <li>
                This prioritisation allows you to save time on less critical

              </li>
              <li>
                This allows you to estimate how long each task will take and

        <h4 id="headd">Avoid multitasking</h4><br>
        <p>
          Avoiding multitasking is a fundamental principle of effective Time
          Management and productivity. It entails focusing on one task at a time
          rather than attempting to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. While
          multitasking may seem like a way to get more done, it often leads to
          decreased efficiency and lower quality work.

              </li>
              <li>
                This heightened focus allows you to understand the task deeply,
                make fewer mistakes and produce higher quality results.

                Avoiding multitasking helps preserve your mental energy,
