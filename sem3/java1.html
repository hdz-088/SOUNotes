        <h1 id="head1">Principles of Object Oriented Language</h1>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An essential element of object-oriented programming is abstraction.
          </li>
          <li>Humans manage complexity through abstraction.</li>
          <li>
            For example, people do not think of a car as a set of tens of
            thousands of individual parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            They think of it as a well-defined object with its own unique
            behaviour
          </li>
          <li>
            This abstraction allows people to use a car to drive to the grocery
            store without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the parts that
            form the car.
          </li>
          <li>
            They can ignore the details of how the engine, transmission, and
            braking systems work.
          </li>
          <li>Instead, they are free to utilize the object as a whole.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Encapsulation</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data
            it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and
            misuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that
            prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other
            code defined outside the wrapper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to the code and data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled
            through a well-defined interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            To relate this to the real world, consider the automatic
            transmission on an automobile.
          </li>
          <li>
            It encapsulates hundreds of bits of information about your engine,
            such as how much you are accelerating, the pitch of the surface you
            are on, and the position of the shift lever.
          </li>
          <li>
            You, as the user, have only one method of affecting this complex
            encapsulation: by moving the gear-shift lever.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can&#39;t affect the transmission by using the turn signal or
            windshield wipers, for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thus, the gear-shift lever is a well-defined (indeed, unique)
            interface to the transmission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Further, what occurs inside the transmission does not affect objects
            outside the transmission.
          </li>
          <li>For example, shifting gears does not turn on the headlights!</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the
            properties of another object.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is important because it supports the concept of hierarchical
            (that is, top-down) classification.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, a Golden Retriever is part of the classification dog,
            which in turn is part of the mammal class, which is under the larger
            class animal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without the use of hierarchies, each object would need to define all
            of its characteristics explicitly.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, by use of inheritance, an object need only define those
            qualities that make it unique within its class.
          </li>
          <li>It can inherit its general attributes from its parent.</li>
          <li>
            Thus, it is the inheritance mechanism that makes it possible for one
            object to be a specific instance of a more general case.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Polymorphism (from the Greek, meaning &quot;many forms&quot;) is a
            feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of
            actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the
            situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extending the dog analogy, a dog&#39;s sense of smell is
            polymorphic. If the dog smells a cat, it will bark and run after it.
            If the dog smells its food, it will salivate and run to its bowl.
            The same sense of smell is at work in both situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The difference is what is being smelled, that is, the type of data
            being operated upon by the dog&#39;s nose! This same general concept
            can be implemented in Java as it applies to methods within a Java
            program.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="head2">Java Essentials</h1>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The core topics for Java syntax include:
            <ul>
              <li>What is an Object</li>
              <li>What is a Class</li>
              <li>What is a variable</li>
              <li>What is a method</li>
              <li><code>System.out.println()</code> method</li>
              <li>Primitive types</li>
              <li>String</li>
              <li>Basic arithmetic and logical operators</li>
              <li>if-else statement</li>
              <li>Loop statements</li>
              <li>Arrays</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Object Oriented Programming:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java programming is mostly about object oriented.</li>
          <li>
            This is the reason when you are starting out with Java, you must
            have a good understanding of OOP.
          </li>
          <li>
            This won’t be difficult to learn, but it involves a lot of practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Begin by understanding what an object is, how diverse attributes can
            be and how these are presented in Java.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Collection Framework:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It offers an architecture to collect and exploit groups of objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            By utilising collections you can perform specific data operations
            such as modification, insertion, deletion, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowledge of collection is considered crucial for interviews as well
            as live projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Often during an interview, you will be required to steer through
            collections and their features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is an unusual situation, but you should learn about them and it
            is not that complex.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a great way for simplifying bug detection and widely used by
            Java programmers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Generics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generics facilitate an alternative to rigid definitions of the types
            of use. At first you won’t find this topic complicated. The more
            grasp you have on this the better you will be able to code.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Multithreading:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This can be difficult to learn for beginners. However, it is not
            considered an essential topic to master especially during
            interviews. As a beginner you might not be actually applying
            multithreading in any project but it will come handy later on.
          </li>

        <h1 id="head3">Java Compilation Process</h1>
        <br />
        <div class="images">

        </div>

        <h1 id="head4">Java Virtual Machine</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The key that allows Java to solve both the security and the
            portability problems just described is that the output of a Java
            compiler is not executable code. Rather, it is
            <strong>bytecode</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be
            executed by the Java run-time system, which is called the
            <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> (JVM).
          </li>
          <li>
            That is, in its standard form, the JVM is an interpreter for
            bytecode.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head5">Just In Time (JIT)</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Although Java was designed for interpretation, there is technically
            nothing about Java that prevents on-the-fly compilation of bytecode
            into native code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Along these lines, Sun has just completed its Just In Time (JIT)
            compiler for bytecode, which is included in the Java 2 release.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the JIT compiler is part of the JVM, it compiles bytecode into
            executable code in real time, on a piece-by-piece, demand basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to understand that it is not possible to compile an
            entire Java program into executable code all at once, because Java
            performs various run-time checks that can be done only at run time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead, the JIT <strong>compiles code as it is needed</strong>,
            during execution. However, the just-in-time approach still yields a
            significant performance boost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even when dynamic compilation is applied to bytecode, the
            portability and safety features still apply, because the run-time
            system (which performs the compilation) still is in charge of the
            execution environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether your Java program is actually interpreted in the traditional
            way or compiled on-the-fly, its functionality is the same.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head6">First Simple Program</h1>
        <br />
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Example.java

class FirstProgram
{
	// Your program begins with a call to main().
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		 System.out.println("Hello World");
	 }
}</code></pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first line <code>Class FirstProgram</code> declares a class,
            which is an object-oriented construct.
          </li>
          <li>
            As stated earlier, java is true object oriented language and
            therefore, everything must be placed inside a class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every class definition in java begins with an opening brace
            <code>{</code> and ends with a matching closing brace <code>}</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The third line
            <code>public static void main(String args[])</code> defines a method
            named main. Conceptually, this is similar to the main() function in
            C/C++.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="assets/img/1java02.png" width="90%" />
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Every java application program must include the
            <code>main()</code> method.
          </li>
          <li>
            The keyword <code>public</code> is an access specifier that declares
            the main method as unprotected and therefore making it accessible to
            all other classes
          </li>
          <li>
            The keyword <code>static</code> declares this method as one that
            belongs to the entire class and not a part of any objects of the
            class.
          </li>
          <li>
            The type modifier <code>void</code> states that the main method does
            not return any value
          </li>
          <li>
            All parameters to a method are declared inside a pair of
            parentheses. Here, <code>String a[]</code> declares a parameter
            named <code>a</code> ,which contains an array of objects of the
            class type String.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is the starting point for the interpreter to begin the
            execution of the program.
          </li>
          <li>
            A java application can have any number of classes but only one of
            them must include a main method to initiate the execution.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head7">Java Program Structure</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Java program may contain many classes of which only one class
            defines a main method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Classes contain data members and methods that operate on the data
            members of the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Method may contain data type declarations and executable statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            To write a java program, we first define classes and then put them
            together.

            <strong>Package Statement:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The First statement allowed in java file is a package statement.
              </li>
              <li>
                This statement declares a package name and informs the compiler
                that the classes defined here belong to this package.
              </li>
              <li>Example: <code>package student;</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />

            <strong>Import Statements:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The next thing after a package statement (but before any class
                definition) may be a number of import statements.
              </li>
              <li>Example: <code>Import student.test;</code></li>
              <li>
                This statement instructs the interpreter to load the test class
                contained in the package student.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using import statements, we can have access to classes that are
                part of other named packages.

            <strong>Interface Statements:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An interface is like a class but includes a group of method
                declarations.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is used only when we wish to implement the multiple
                inheritance feature in the program.

              <li>
                Classes are the primary and essential elements of a java
                program.
              </li>
              <li>
                The number of classes used depends on the complexity of the
                problem.

            <strong>Main Method Class:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Every java program requires a main method as its starting point,
                this class is the essential part of a java program.
              </li>
              <li>A simple java program may contain only this part.</li>
              <li>
                The main method creates objects of various classes and
                establishes communications between them.
              </li>
              <li>On reaching the end of main the program terminates.</li>

        <h1 id="head8">Variables</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The variable is the <strong>basic unit of storage</strong> in a Java
            program.
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is defined by the combination of an identifier, a type,
            and an optional initializer.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition, all variables have a scope, which defines their
            visibility, and a lifetime.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Java, all variables must be declared before they can be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            The basic form of a variable declaration is :
            <code>type identifier = value;</code>
          </li>
          <li>Example: <code>int num = 10;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Dynamic Initialization:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Although the preceding examples have used only constants as
            initializers, Java allows variables to be initialized dynamically,
            using any expression valid at the time the variable is declared.
          </li>
          <li>For example</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Demonstrate dynamic initialization.

class DynInit {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		double a = 3.0, b = 4.0;
		
		// c is dynamically initialized
		double c = Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b);
		System.out.println("Hypotenuse is " + c);
	}
}</code></pre>

          <li>
            Primitive Data Types:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Java defines eight simple (or elemental) types of data: byte,
                short, int, long, char, float, double, and Boolean. These can be
                put in four groups
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integers</strong> This group includes byte, short, int,
                and long, which are for whole-valued signed numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Floating-point</strong> numbers This group includes
                float and double, which represent numbers with fractional
                precision.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characters</strong> This group includes char, which
                represents symbols in a character set, like letters and numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Boolean</strong> This group includes Boolean, which is a
                special type for representing true/false values.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Non-Primitive Data Type:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Class</strong> contains a set of properties and methods
                that are common and exhibited by all the
                <strong>objects</strong> of the class.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Array</strong> are used to store elements of the same
                data type in a contiguous manner
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interface</strong> in Java is a tool to achieve
                abstraction. Interface can contain non-implemented methods
                (without the method body) also known as abstract methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strings</strong> are capable of containing sequences of
                characters within a single variable
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head10">Identifiers</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Identifiers are used for <strong>class names</strong>, method names,
            and variable names.
          </li>
          <li>
            An identifier may be any descriptive sequence of uppercase and
            lowercase letters, numbers, or the underscore and dollar-sign
            characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            They must not begin with a number, lest they be confused with a
            numeric literal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Again, Java is case-sensitive, so <code>VALUE</code> is a different
            identifier than <code>Value</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head11">Literals</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <strong>constant value</strong> in Java is created by using a
            literal representation of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, here are some literals: <code>100</code>
            <code>98.6</code> <code>&#39;X&#39;</code>
            <code>&quot;This is a test&quot;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The first literal specifies an integer, the next is a floating-point
            value, the third is a character constant, and the last is a string.
          </li>
          <li>A literal can be used anywhere a value of its type is allow</li>
        </ul>

                It is similar to while loop with the difference that condition

        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A class is a <strong>collection of objects of similar type</strong>.
            Once a class is defined, any number of objects can be produced which
            belong to that class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Classes provide a convenient method for packing together a group of
            logically related data items and functions that work on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            In java, the data items are called <strong>fields</strong> and the
            functions are called <strong>methods</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Objects</strong> are instances of the Class. Classes and
            Objects are very much related to each other. Without objects you
            can&#39;t use a class.

        <h1 id="head18">Instance Variable</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>All variables are also known as instance variable.</li>
          <li>
            This is because of the fact that each instance or object has its own
            copy of values for the variables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hence other use of the <code>.</code> (dot) operator is to
            initialize the value of variable for that instance.

        <h1 id="head19">Constructor</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Constructor is <strong>special member function</strong> of the
            class.
          </li>
          <li>The name of a constructor must be the name of the class.</li>
          <li>
            Constructor is <strong>used to initialize the values</strong> to the
            data member of the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Constructor have <strong>no return type</strong>, even we cannot
            write even void before constructor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Constructor is <strong>called when object is created</strong>.
            Constructor can&#39;t be called explicitly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Constructor <strong>can be private, public or protected</strong>.
            Constructors cannot be abstract, final, native, static, or
            synchronized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Just like member functions, constructors
            <strong>can also be overloaded</strong> in a class.
          </li>
          <li>Constructor can be invoked called by its derived class.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If we don&#39;t want to pass any value at the time of creation
                of the object and want to initialize something that time we can
                create without argument constructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Constructor without parameter or say argument is known as
                without argument constructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Objects which call without argument constructor have same values
                in its field.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>With Argument Constructor:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With Argument Constructor also known as parameterized
                constructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Parameterized constructors are required to pass parameters on
                creation of objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Here all the objects have different unique distinct copies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because they passed value at the time of calling parameterized
                constructor.

          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Default Constructor:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If we don&#39;t define a constructor, then the compiler creates
                a default constructor. This generated constructor is called a
                default constructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                It&#39;s not visible in our code, but it&#39;s there just the
                same.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember Default constructors are created only if there are no
                constructors defined by us.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we do write a constructor for our class, Java does not
                generate a default constructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Default constructors initialize 0 to all the numeric and NULL to
                all the objects.
