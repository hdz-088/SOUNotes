        <br />
        <li>Flutter is framework created by <strong>Google</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          It is an Open-Source cross-platform framework used to develop
          application for Android, iOS, Web, Desktop
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dart</strong> Programming language is used for Flutter</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 id="head2">Why Flutter</h1>
        <br />
        <li>
          Flutter is Open-Source framework Therefore anyone can use it for any
          given purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flutter is so fast that it takes less than 30 sec for first full
          compilation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comes with <strong>Hot-Reload</strong> &amp;
          <strong>Hot-Restart</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to Stateful widget hot-reload feature Flutter is very
          <strong>fast</strong> iterative coding style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ready to use <strong>widget</strong>, Flutter has many widgets that
          you can use to build flutter application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flutter Community is bit small if we compare with other framework like
          React.
        </li>
        <li>But Flutter is growing very fast then other framework.</li>
        <li>
          Anyone who have basic knowledge of OOPS &amp; UI Designing can easily
          learn Flutter.
        </li>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head3">Features of Flutter</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Open-Source:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Flutter is a free and open-source framework for developing
                mobile applications.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-platform:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This feature allows Flutter to write the code once, maintain,
                and can run on different platforms.
              </li>
              <li>It saves the time, effort, and money of the developers.</li>
              <li>Minimal Coding.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Hot Reload:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Whenever the developer makes changes in the code, then these
                changes can be seen instantaneously with Hot Reload.
              </li>
              <li>
                It means the changes immediately visible in the app itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is a very handy feature, which allows the developer to fix
                the bugs instantly.
              </li>
              <li>Hot Reload &amp; Hot Restart.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Accessible Native Features and SDKs:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This feature allows the app development process easy and
                delightful through Flutter&#39;s native code, third-party
                integration, and platform APIs.
              </li>
              <li>Thus, we can easily access the SDKs on both platforms.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Minimal code:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Flutter app is developed by Dart programming language, which
                uses JIT and AOT compilation to improve the overall start-up
                time, functioning and accelerates the performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                JIT enhances the development system and refreshes the UI without
                putting extra effort into building a new one.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Widgets:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Flutter framework offers widgets, which are capable of
                developing customisable specific designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most importantly, Flutter has two sets of widgets: Material
                Design and Cupertino widgets that help to provide a glitch-free
                experience on all platforms.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head4">Advantages of Flutter</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            It makes the app development process extremely fast because of the
            <strong>hot-reload</strong> feature. This feature allows us to
            change or update the code are reflected as soon as the alterations
            are made.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides the smoother and seamless scrolling experiences of using
            the app without much hangs or cuts, which makes running applications
            faster in comparison to other mobile app development frameworks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flutter reduces the time and efforts of testing. As we know, flutter
            apps are <strong>cross-platform</strong> so that testers do not
            always need to run the same set of tests on different platforms for
            the same app.
          </li>
          <li>
            It has an excellent user interface because it uses a design-centric
            widget, high-development tools, advanced APIs, and many more
            features.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is similar to a reactive framework where the developers do not
            need to update the UI content manually.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is suitable for
            <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong> apps because of its
            speedy development process and cross-platform nature.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head5">Disadvantages of Flutter</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Flutter is a comparatively <strong>new language</strong> that
            needs continuous integration support through the maintenance of
            scripts.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides very <strong>limited access to SDK libraries</strong>.
            It means a developer does not have a lot of functionalities to
            create a mobile application. Such types of functionalities need to
            be developed by the Flutter developer themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            It uses <strong>Dart</strong> programming for coding, so a developer
            needs to learn new technologies. However, it is easy to learn for
            developers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head6">Flutter Installation in Windows</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>System Requirements:</strong>
            <ul>

                you have selected the recommended option.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Install Flutter SDK:</strong><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Step-01:</strong> Download the installation bundle of
                the Flutter Software Development Kit for windows. To download
                Flutter SDK, Go to its official
                <a href="https://flutter.dev/">website</a>, click on Get started
                button
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-02:</strong> Next, to download the latest Flutter
                SDK, click on the Windows icon. Here, you will find the download
                link for SDK.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-03:</strong> When your download is complete,
                extract the zip file and place it in the desired installation
                folder or location.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-04:</strong> To run the Flutter command in regular
                windows console, you need to update the system path to include
                the flutter bin directory. The following steps are required to
                do this:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-04.01:</strong> Go to
                    <code
                      >My Computer -&gt; properties -&gt; advanced tab -&gt;
                      environment variables</code
                    >.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-04.02:</strong> Now, select
                    <code>path -&gt; click on edit</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-04.03:</strong> In the above window, click on
                    <code>New</code> &gt; write path of Flutter bin folder in
                    variable value click ok.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-05:</strong> Now, run the
                <code>flutter doctor</code> command. This command checks for all
                the requirements of Flutter app development and displays a
                report of the status of your Flutter installation.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-06:</strong> When you run the above command, it
                will analyse the system and show its report. Here, you will find
                the details of all missing tools, which required running Flutter
                as well as the development tools that are available but not
                connected with the device.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-07:</strong> Install the Android SDK. If the
                flutter doctor command does not find the Android SDK tool in
                your system, then you need first to install the Android Studio
                IDE. Install by doing following steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-07.01:</strong> Download the latest Android
                    Studio executable or zip file from the
                    <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"
                      >official site</a
                    >.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-07.02:</strong> When the download is complete,
                    open the .exe file and run it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-07.03:</strong> Follow the steps of the
                    installation wizard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-07.04:</strong> After Installation is complete,
                    click <code>Next -&gt; Finish</code>. Once the Finish button
                    is clicked, you need to choose the
                    <code>Don&#39;t import Settings</code> option and click
                    <code>OK</code>. It will start the Android Studio.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Step-08:</strong> Next, you need to set up an Android
                emulator. It is responsible for running and testing the Flutter
                application.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-08.01:</strong> To set an Android emulator, go
                    to
                    <code
                      >Android Studio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; AVD
                      Manager</code
                    >
                    and select <code>Create Virtual Device</code>. Or, go to
                    <code
                      >Help -&gt; Find Action -&gt; Type Emulator in the search
                      box</code
                    >

        <h1 id="head8">Architecture of Flutter</h1>
        <br />
        <p>The Flutter architecture mainly comprises of 4 components:</p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Flutter Engine:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It is a portable runtime for high-quality mobile apps and
                primarily based on the <strong>C++ language</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                It implements Flutter core libraries that include animation and
                graphics, file and network I/O, plugin architecture,
                accessibility support, and a dart runtime for developing,
                compiling, and running Flutter applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                It takes Google&#39;s open-source graphics library,
                <strong>Skia</strong>, to render low-level graphics.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p><strong>Foundation Library:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It contains all the <strong>required packages</strong> for the
                basic building blocks of writing a Flutter application. These
                libraries are written in Dart language.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p><strong>Widgets:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In Flutter, everything is a widget, which is the
                <strong>core concept</strong> of this framework.
              </li>
              <li>
                Widget in the Flutter is basically a UI component that affects
                and controls the view and interface of the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                It represents an immutable description of part of the user
                interface and includes graphics, text, shapes, and animations
                that are created using widgets.
              </li>
              <li>The widgets are similar to the React components.</li>
              <li>
                In Flutter, the application is itself a widget that contains
                many <strong>sub widgets</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                It means the app is the <strong>top-level widget</strong>, and
                its UI is build using one or more
                <strong>children widgets</strong>, which again includes
                <strong>sub child widgets</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                This feature helps you to create a complex user interface very
                easily.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class="images">
            <img src="assets/img/flu01.png" alt="widget" width="90%" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p><strong>Design Specific Widgets:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Flutter framework has two sets of widgets that conform to
                specific design languages. These are
                <strong>Material Design for Android</strong> application and
                <strong>Cupertino Style for IOS</strong> application.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head9">Gestures</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is a widget that provides interaction (how to listen for and
            respond to) in Flutter using <strong>GestureDetector</strong>.
            GestureDetector is an invisible widget, which includes tapping,
            dragging, and scaling interaction of its child widget. We can also
            use other interactive features into the existing widgets by
            composing with the GestureDetector widget.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head10">State Management</h1>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flutter widget maintains its state by using a special widget,
            StatefulWidget. It is always auto re-rendered whenever its internal
            state is changed. The re-rendering is optimised by calculating the
            distance between old and new widget UI and render only necessary
            things that are changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h1 id="head11">Layers</h1>
        <br />
        <div class="images">
          <img src="assets/img/flu0a.jpg" alt="" width="90%" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Layers are an important concept of the Flutter framework, which are
            grouped into multiple categories in terms of complexity and arranged
            in the top-down approach.
          </li>
          <li>
            The topmost layer is the <strong>UI</strong> of the application,
            which is specific to the Android and iOS platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second topmost layer contains all the Flutter
            <strong>native widgets</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next layer is the <strong>rendering</strong> layer, which
            renders everything in the Flutter app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, the layers go down to Gestures, foundation library, engine,
            and finally, core platform-specific code. The following diagram
            specifies the layers in Flutter app development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />

          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Step-03:</strong> In the next wizard, you need to choose the
            Flutter Application. For this, select
            <code>Flutter Application -&gt; click Next</code>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>

            <strong>MyHomePage</strong> is similar to MyApp, except it will

            widget after the MaterialApp widget for creating the user interface.
            This widget contains two properties <strong>appBar</strong> and
            <strong>body</strong>. The appBar shows the header of the app, and
            body property shows the actual content of the application.

                It doesn&#39;t matter because we are not going to work with

          Flutter Application Architecture With Layered Approach
        </h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Flutter applications can benefit from a layered architecture, which
          separates concerns and promotes code maintainability.

          <li>
            <strong>Presentation Layer (UI):</strong><br />
            <ul>
              <li>This layer deals with how the app looks and feels.</li>
              <li>
                It utilizes Flutter&#39;s widgets to build the user interface
                (UI) elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                This layer is built using stateless or stateful widgets
                depending on data requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                It interacts with the application layer to request data or
                trigger actions.
              </li>

          </li>

            <strong>Application layer (Business Logic):</strong><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                This layer handles the core business logic of the app. It
                manages user interactions, data validation, and application
                flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                It interacts with the domain layer to access and manipulate data
                relevant to the app&#39;s functionality.
              </li>
              <li>
                This layer might use state management solutions like Provider,
                BLoC, or Scoped Model to manage application state.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Domain Layer (Models &amp; Rules):</strong><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                This layer represents the core domain concepts and rules of the
                app.
              </li>
              <li>
                It defines data models (classes) that represent entities like
                users, products, or tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                It encapsulates business logic rules specific to the app&#39;s
                domain
              </li>
              <li>
                This layer interacts with the data layer to fetch and store
                data.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <strong>Data Layer (Persistence):</strong><br />
            <ul>
              <li>This layer handles data persistence and retrieval.</li>
              <li>
                It interacts with local databases (e.g., Hive, SQlite) or remote
                APIs (e.g., using HTTP libraries) to access and store data.
              </li>
              <li>
                It retrieves and stores data based on requests from the domain
                layer.
              </li>
              <li>
                This layer should strive for data abstraction, allowing
                switching between data sources without affecting the rest of the
                app.
